# NYT-Letterboxd-Solver

This is a personal project. I've always loved word puzzles and games, and thought to create a solver for NYT Letterboxd for fun. I plan to build more solvers in the future for other games, and to upload them all to a personal website for any and all to use.

The algorithms I created took many hours to design and fine-tune, and they can certainly be further optimized. I plan to come back to this project to make the algorithms more efficient after I gain more programming experience and knowledge.
